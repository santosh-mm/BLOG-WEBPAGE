    <h1>INTRODUCTION TO CSS</h1>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. Where HTML is what defines the structure 
        and content of a web page, a Cascading Style 
        Sheet is a web document that allows you to change the appearance of the HTML.

        CSS allows you to change the size, style, font, and color of text; 
        margins and padding; background colors and border styles. It can also be used to 
        position elements on a page (but weâ€™ll leave that for another day).</p>
        <h1>HISTORY OF CSS</h1>
        <P>The first version of CSS was invented. 1998- CSS 2 was released and work on CSS 3 began. 
            CSS 3 was very different from the other versions, fot instead of being a single monolithic specification, 
            it was published as a set of separate documents known as modules.
            </P>
